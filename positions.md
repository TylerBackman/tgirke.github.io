## Open Positions

### Postdoctoral position in genome data science

This position is about the development of integrative analysis methods for
multidimensional data sets from a variety of next generation sequencing (NGS)
technologies and their implementation in form of R/Bioconductor packages.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: (I) Ph.D. and/or postdoctoral training in an area
related  to computational biology, biostatistics and genome biology. (II)
Several years of experience with R/Bioconductor package development including
programming in C/C++. (III) High-level of proficiency in analyzing NGS data,
including RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, Methyl-Seq, VAR-Seq, etc. (IV) Strong publication
record. OTHER HANDS-ON EXPERIENCE: (i) Data analysis programming
environments for reproducible research. (ii) Parallelization of data analysis
tasks on computer clusters. (iii) Experience with Python, database and web
service development is also a plus. To apply for this position, please email
your CV, statement of research interests and names of at least three references
to Thomas Girke (thomas.girke@ucr.edu).
