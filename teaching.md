> I enjoy teaching classes and mentoring students and postdocs, and consider it
to be one of the unique privileges of my profession. My greatest pleasure as a
teacher comes during those moments when students transition from simply
listening and reading the material to actually understanding it, and thereby
advancing to independently solving problems relevant for their future research
career. 

## Courses

### [Data Analysis in Genome Biology - GEN242](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242)

[[Syllabus](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/mydoc_syllabus.html)]

Introduction to algorithms, statistical methods and data analysis skills for
genome biology. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis,
phylogenetics, comparative genomics and network biology. The hands-on data
analysis components include homework assignments and course projects focusing
on data analysis programming of _next generation genome data_ using Linux
command-line tools and the programming environment R. 4 units, 4 hours lecture,
2 hours discussion.
