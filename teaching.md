I enjoy teaching classes and advising students, postdocs and coworkers. I
consider it to be one of the fantastic privileges of my profession. My greatest
pleasure as a teacher comes at those moments in a class when students
transition from simply listening and reading the material to actually
understanding it, and thereby enabling them to solve real application and research
problems on their own.


## Courses

### [Data Analysis in Genome Biology - GEN242](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242)

[[Syllabus Spring-2016](http://girke.bioinformatics.ucr.edu/GEN242/mydoc/mydoc_syllabus.html)]

Introduction to algorithms, statistical methods and data analysis skills for
genome biology. The lecture topics cover databases, sequence (NGS) analysis,
phylogenetics, comparative genomics and network biology. The hands-on data
analysis components include homework assignments and course projects focusing
on data analysis programming of _next generation genome data_ using Linux
command-line tools and the programming environment R. 4 units, 4 hours lecture,
2 hours discussion. 

### Introduction to Genomics and Bioinformatics - BIOL119

[[Syllabus Fall-2015](https://goo.gl/BXSyD8)]

Introduction to the science of genomics and bioinformatics, including genome
integrated sequencing, database techniques, comparative and evolutionary
genomics, and microarray analysis. 4 units, 3 hours lecture; 1 hour computer
lab. Prerequisites: BIOL 005A, BIOL 05LA, BIOL 005B, BIOL 005C, BIOL 102, CHEM
